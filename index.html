                            I am Yasmin T. Casing.<sup><b>1</b></sup> I was born and raised in Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines, and I am 20 years old now.<sup><b>2</b></sup> My childhood was full of fun and happy moments.<sup><b>3</b></sup> I was just a normal kid who loved playing outside with my friends.<sup><b>4</b></sup> We ran, played different traditional games, and laughed a lot.<sup><b>5</b></sup> Sometimes, we got small cuts or bruises from playing, but we didn't mind.<sup><b>6</b></sup> I also liked playing with LEGOs.<sup><b>7</b></sup> I built different lego characters, cars, and one of my favorite lego sets was called Ninjago.<sup><b>8</b></sup> It made me feel happy and creative.<sup><b>9</b></sup> My friends and I never got bored.<sup><b>10</b></sup> I also liked watching cartoons and eating snacks.<sup><b>11</b></sup> My family took care of me and made me feel safe.<sup><b>12</b></sup> I remember birthday parties with balloons and cake.<sup><b>13</b></sup> School was also part of my childhood.<sup><b>14</b></sup> Growing up, I didn't like math, but I loved science and learning about how planets were made.<sup><b>15</b></sup> I also didn't like homework, but I always tried my best.<sup><b>16</b></sup> Back then, I didn't know much about technology until my friends invited me to play PlayStation games with them, and I had so much fun.<sup><b>17</b></sup> Another fun memory was when my father, who worked abroad, brought me a Sony PSP 3000, a handheld gaming console, when he came back home.<sup><b>18</b></sup> I downloaded different games on it, and it became one of my best memories.<sup><b>19</b></sup> My parents' hometown is in Guindulman, Bohol.<sup><b>20</b></sup> Every year, we visit our house there.<sup><b>21</b></sup> We go home to see our grandparents and enjoy the place.<sup><b>22</b></sup> The beaches and views are very beautiful and clean.<sup><b>23</b></sup> The locals are also very friendly and approachable.<sup><b>24</b></sup> That's why I made friends there when my parents first brought me to our province.<sup><b>25</b></sup> The fresh air always made me feel calm and happy.<sup><b>26</b></sup> Bohol is a big part of my childhood.<sup><b>27</b></sup> The friends I made there and I played together.<sup><b>28</b></sup> We ran in the fields and had fun.<sup><b>29</b></sup> We wandered around the fishponds and they guided me around our small barangay.<sup><b>30</b></sup> They made me feel welcome as their friend.<sup><b>31</b></sup> Remembering those moments back then feels like a warm hug to me as a child.<sup><b>32</b></sup> The smell of the trees and the ocean always made me happy.<sup><b>33</b></sup> It feels like my second home.<sup><b>34</b></sup> I miss those days, and I will always remember them.<sup><b>35</b></sup> My childhood was simple, fun, and full of love, and I will always keep those memories in my heart.<sup><b>36</b></sup>

                            My teenage years were a time of change and learning new things.<sup><b>1</b></sup> I began to understand who I am and what I like.<sup><b>2</b></sup> I started making more decisions on my own and faced new challenges.<sup><b>3</b></sup> There were happy moments and some difficult ones, but all of them helped me grow.<sup><b>4</b></sup> My teenage years taught me many lessons about friendships, responsibility, and finding my way.<sup><b>5</b></sup> One big change was entering high school.<sup><b>6</b></sup> It was a new chapter in my life with new teachers, subjects, and activities.<sup><b>7</b></sup> I felt nervous at first, but over time, I got used to everything.<sup><b>8</b></sup> In junior high school, I was able to keep my old friends from elementary school, but I also got a chance to learn more about my future.<sup><b>9</b></sup> I was excited but also worried about meeting new people.<sup><b>10</b></sup> I joined the choir and sports clubs, like volleyball training, for a short period of time.<sup><b>11</b></sup> I also had the chance to play badminton, where I competed against people from my section and other sections, and I won a 3rd place medal.<sup><b>12</b></sup> It was a fun way to meet new people and get involved in school activities.<sup><b>13</b></sup> I learned that high school wasn't only about getting good grades, but also about growing as a person.<sup><b>14</b></sup> I struggled with some subjects like math, but I worked hard and started to do better.<sup><b>15</b></sup> I also began learning more about things I enjoy, like science and technology.<sup><b>16</b></sup> Some days were hard, and I felt stressed, but I learned how to manage my time better.<sup><b>17</b></sup> I became more curious about different topics and wanted to know more.<sup><b>18</b></sup> My friends were very important to me in high school.<sup><b>19</b></sup> We laughed, studied, and made many good memories together.<sup><b>20</b></sup> I also learned how to balance my schoolwork with fun.<sup><b>21</b></sup> High school was a time for me to figure out what I'm good at and what I want to do in the future.<sup><b>22</b></sup> It gave me many experiences that shaped who I am now.<sup><b>23</b></sup> After junior high school, I went into senior high school and chose the STEM strand.<sup><b>24</b></sup> This is also when I transferred to a university in Manila, which gave me new opportunities to learn and grow.<sup><b>25</b></sup> During my senior high school years, I realized that I have a strong passion for technology and that it aligns well with my skills.<sup><b>26</b></sup> My parents were very supportive and glad for me in taking this program.<sup><b>27</b></sup> I am very thankful for everything I learned during this time, which helped me decide what I want to do in the future.<sup><b>28</b></sup> When I graduated from senior high, I felt prepared for the next step.<sup><b>29</b></sup> High school offered me many things and helped me decide what I wanted to pursue in the future.<sup><b>30</b></sup> Despite personal struggles and academic obstacles, I gained confidence in myself and my decisions.<sup><b>31</b></sup> I'm looking forward to what the future holds and the new experiences college will offer me.<sup><b>32</b></sup>
